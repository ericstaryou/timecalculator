					<span>In this digital era where people are always striving
						to achieve the best in their life and also never stop
						planning ahead, they often forget to live in the moment.
						They would rather make plans way ahead from where
						they are right now than enjoying what they have right
						now. People are too scared that if they have no plans
						for their future, they will lose everything. In fact, if
						one is too busy planning ahead but forget to live in the
					moment, it does not benefit as well.</span>
