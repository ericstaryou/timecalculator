# timecalculator
## A super simple client-side project for a Graphic Designer friend. 

This is also a client-side only web application that is being hosted using GitPages. You may access the website [here](https://ericstaryou.github.io/timecalculator/).

It is meant to be light weight thus there are no server side programming, database configuration, CSS preprocessor, or any JS framework required. 

The tech stacks used are purely HTML, CSS, and JS. Firebase is being used as the database.
